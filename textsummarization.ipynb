Today, it is indeed a thanks giving occasion. I would like to narr ate, how I \\nenjoyed every minute of my tenure enriched by the wonderful assoc iation from each one \\nof you, hailing from different walks of life, be it politics, sci ence and technology, \\nacademics, arts, literature, business, judiciary, administration, local bodies, farming, \\nhome makers, special children, media and above all from the youth and st udent \\ncommunity who are the future wealth of our country. During my intera ction at \\nRashtrapati Bhavan in Delhi and at every state and union territor y as well as through my \\nonline interactions, I have many unique experiences to share with you, which signify the \\nfollowing important messages: \\n \\n1. Accelerate development : Aspiration of the youth, \\n \\n2. Empower villages, \\n \\n3. Mobilize rural core competence for competitiveness, \\n \\n4. Seed to Food: Backbone for agricultural growth \\n \\n5. Defeat problems and succeed, \\n \\n6. Overcome problems through partnership, \\n \\n7. Courage in combating calamities, \\n \\n8.

Youth movement for Developed India 2020. \\n \\nNow let me share with you each of the messages. \\n \\nAccelerate Development: Aspiration of the youth \\nWhile there were many significant events during my tenure, a que stion from a little girl \\nAnukriti of Sri Sathya Sai Jagriti Vidya Mandir School, of Dar wa village from Haryana, \\nduring children’s visit to Rashtrapati Bhavan on May 22, 2006, rings in my  mind ever \\nafter. \\n \\nAnukriti asked me “why India cannot become a developed nation before the year 2020”.

This question reflects how the desire t o live in developed \\nIndia has entered into the minds of the youth. The same feelings are  echoed by over \\nfifteen lakh youth, whom I have met so far and who represent the drea m of the 540 \\nmillion youth of the nation. The aspirations of the young to live in a prosperous, safe and \\nproud India should be the guiding factor in whatever profession we contribute. \\n \\nEmpower Villages \\nFriends, I recall my visit to Nagaland on 26th October 2002, soon after m y assuming \\noffice as President. It was a unique experience for me at Khuza ma village to meet tribal \\nvillage council members and discuss with them the village progress  and the dream of \\nvillage citizens. I was very happy to see the empowered village  council functioning with \\nfinancial powers and taking decisions. I saw a prosperous village with fruits and \\nvegetables production. However, there is a need for providing physical c onnectivity in \\nNagaland through quality roads for enabling faster movement of produ cts from villages \\nto the market. That meeting gave me a powerful message about the t ransformation which \\ncan take place to the 600,000 villages of India, if all the villages a re empowered to deal \\nwith their development and are well connected among themselves and wit h the urban \\nsocieties. \\n \\nMobilizing rural core competence for competitiveness \\nNow I would like to talk about the initiative of Periyar Maniammai  College of \\nTechnology for Women, Vallam, Tanjore of Providing Urban Amenities in Rural Areas \\n(PURA) complex involving 65 villages with a population of 3 lakhs. This inc ludes \\nprovision of three connectivities - physical, electronic and knowledge  - leading to \\neconomic connectivity. Periyar PURA has health care centers, pr imary to post graduate \\nlevel education and vocational training centers. This has resulted i n large-scale \\nemployment generation and creation of number of entrepreneurs with the  active support \\nof 1000 self-help groups. Two hundred acres of waste land has been develope d into a \\ncultivable land.

The aspirations of the young to live in a prosperous, safe and \\nproud India should be the guiding factor in whatever profession we contribute. \\n \\nEmpower Villages \\nFriends, I recall my visit to Nagaland on 26th October 2002, soon after m y assuming \\noffice as President. It was a unique experience for me at Khuza ma village to meet tribal \\nvillage council members and discuss with them the village progress  and the dream of \\nvillage citizens. I was very happy to see the empowered village  council functioning with \\nfinancial powers and taking decisions. I saw a prosperous village with fruits and \\nvegetables production. However, there is a need for providing physical c onnectivity in \\nNagaland through quality roads for enabling faster movement of produ cts from villages \\nto the market. That meeting gave me a powerful message about the t ransformation which \\ncan take place to the 600,000 villages of India, if all the villages a re empowered to deal \\nwith their development and are well connected among themselves and wit h the urban \\nsocieties. \\n \\nMobilizing rural core competence for competitiveness \\nNow I would like to talk about the initiative of Periyar Maniammai  College of \\nTechnology for Women, Vallam, Tanjore of Providing Urban Amenities in Rural Areas \\n(PURA) complex involving 65 villages with a population of 3 lakhs. This inc ludes \\nprovision of three connectivities - physical, electronic and knowledge  - leading to \\neconomic connectivity. Periyar PURA has health care centers, pr imary to post graduate \\nlevel education and vocational training centers. This has resulted i n large-scale \\nemployment generation and creation of number of entrepreneurs with the  active support \\nof 1000 self-help groups. Two hundred acres of waste land has been develope d into a \\ncultivable land. The villagers are busy in cultivation, planting Jatropha, herbal and \\nmedicinal plants, power generation using bio-mass, food processing and above all \\nrunning marketing centers. It provides a sustainable economic development model for the \\nwhole region. \\n \\nDuring the last eight months, people of Periyar PURA villages technologically supported \\nby Periyar Maniammai College of Engineering for Women have w orked with experts \\nfrom Japan External Trade Organisation (JETRO) on various products, for  which core \\ncompetence and raw material are available in Thanjavur district. They developed \\ninternationally competitive prototypes for 55 life style products wi th support of JETRO \\nspecialists and feedback from exhibitions at Delhi and Tokyo. This co -operative venture \\nhas enhanced the innovative ability of the people of all the 65 villages  enabling them to \\ndevelop and produce internationally acceptable products. I have seen si milar type of \\nPURA being established in many states. The whole country needs 7000 PU RA to \\nbridging the rural – urban divide. \\n \\nSeed to Food: Backbone for agricultural growth'),\n",

Recently, during my address to the agricultural \\nscientists while participating in a National Symposium on “Agri culture Cannot Wait”, I \\nsummarized the many practical suggestions given by farmers. W e have to double the \\nagricultural production with reduced land, reduced water resources and re duced \\nmanpower and improve the economic conditions of the nation through the principle  of \\n“Seed to Food” since agriculture is the backbone of the nation.

His radiant face was revealing his happy state of mi nd. He introduced himself \\nas Vidwan Coimbatore SR Krishna Murthy. I greeted him and asked him  how this had \\nhappened. He smilingly said that it was from by birth. He thanked G od, his parents, \\nteachers and many others for giving him confidence, training and he lp. I asked him, what \\nI could do for him? He said, “I don’t need anything from you. I would like to sing in fr ont \\nof you”. I readily agreed. He sang melodiously the Saint Thyagraj a’s pancha ratna kriti \\nentharo mahanubavulu in Sriragam giving me a glimpse of his talent. I was quite touched. \\nWhat is the message? Despite being physically challenged, the latent talent of music \\ncould blossom in this \\nperson with his positive attitude and perseverance, encouraged by the pa rents, teachers, \\nacademics and rasikas. Now he wants to give, give and give his art to inspire others.

      "Speech:The speech is a farewell address by A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, the former President of India, after completing his five-year term at Rashtrapati Bhavan. He expresses gratitude to the people of India and those living abroad for the opportunity to work with them and share his experiences. He highlights 10 key messages that he wants to convey, focusing on accelerating development, empowering villages, mobilizing rural core competence, and more. He also shares a personal anecdote about a young girl named Anukriti who asked him why India couldn't become a developed nation by 2020, and he assured her that it was a thoughtful question and that he was committed to working towards that goal.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker appreciated the question and assured the person that their dream would be taken to the highest institution of the nation and worked on.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech highlights the importance of empowering villages and mobilizing rural core competence for competitiveness. The speaker, who is likely the President of India, shares their experience of visiting a village in Nagaland and meeting with tribal village council members. They emphasize the need for providing physical connectivity, such as quality roads, to enable faster movement of products from villages to markets.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker also mentions an initiative by Periyar Maniammai College of Technology for Women, which is creating urban amenities in rural areas through a complex involving 65 villages with a population of 3 lakhs. This complex provides physical, electronic, and knowledge connectivity, leading to economic connectivity. It includes healthcare centers, primary to post-graduate level education, and vocational training centers, which has resulted in large-scale employment generation and creation of entrepreneurs.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, the speech emphasizes the importance of empowering villages and mobilizing rural core competence to achieve the dream of a prosperous, safe, and proud India.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech highlights the success of the Periyar PURA (Participatory Urban Rural Action) project in Thanjavur district, which has generated employment and created entrepreneurs through the active support of 1000 self-help groups. The project has developed 200 acres of waste land into cultivatable land, where villagers are engaged in various activities such as cultivation, plantations, food processing, and marketing. The project has also enabled the villagers to develop internationally competitive prototypes for 55 lifestyle products with the support of Japanese experts. The speaker suggests that similar PURA projects need to be established across the country to bridge the rural-urban divide, with a total of 7000 projects needed to achieve this goal.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker is recounting two enriching experiences. The first is meeting over 6,000 farmers from different states and union territories at Rashtrapati Bhavan, where they showed great interest in the various gardens and interacted with horticultural specialists. The speaker emphasized the need to double agricultural production with reduced resources and improve the economic conditions of the nation through the \"Seed to Food\" principle. They also expressed confidence that the nation can increase agricultural GDP growth by 4% per annum through partnerships between farmers, scientists, and industries.\n",
      "\n",
      "The second experience is about a meeting with a person named Vidwan Coimbatore SR Krishna Murthy, who was born without hands and legs. Despite this, he was smiling and radiant. He thanked God, his parents, and others for giving him confidence, training, and help. The speaker asked what they could do for him, and he replied that he wanted to sing in front of them.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker shares two personal experiences that highlight the importance of positivity, perseverance, and giving back to others. The first experience is about a physically challenged individual who, despite his limitations, has a latent talent for music and wants to share it with others. The speaker was touched by his performance and saw it as a testament to the power of positive attitude and encouragement. The second experience is about the aftermath of the 2005 earthquake in Jammu & Kashmir, where the speaker visited Urusa village and was impressed by the resilience and courage of the people in the face of disaster. The speaker saw how the villagers, with the help of the Army, Air Force, and state government, were able to overcome their losses and rebuild their lives. The speaker concludes that it is possible to overcome the impact of disaster through partnership and collective efforts.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech appears to be a reflection on the author's experiences of witnessing courage in the face of calamities. The author describes visiting a village affected by an earthquake and seeing children and villagers bravely participating in relief operations with the Armed Forces. They also recall a visit to the Car Nicobar Islands after the 2004 tsunami, where they were touched by the courage of the islanders who took in affected victims as their own and did not establish orphanages.\n",
      "\n",
      "The author also mentions a poem they composed, \"Sea Waves\", which celebrates the courage and resilience of the islanders. They reflect on the importance of connectivity and societal transformation, pointing to a speech they gave at the Pan African Parliament in 2004.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker proposed a project called the \"Pan African e-Network\" to connect 53 African countries with a seamless and integrated network of satellite, fiber optics, and wireless connections, estimated to cost $100 million. The project aims to connect 12 universities, 17 hospitals, and 53 telemedicine and education centers in Africa. A pilot project for tele-education and tele-medicine has already been launched in Ethiopia, where Indian specialists are providing medical care remotely and an MBA course is being offered to Ethiopian students.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech highlights several achievements and initiatives:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Telemedicine collaboration with Africa: Hyderabad-based doctors are providing live tele-consultations to doctors in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, since 2006. The Pan African network enables instant communication between the 53 African countries.\n",
      "2. National pride: The speaker expresses pride in India's Defence Forces, praising their bravery, commitment, and devotion to duty. They highlight the sacrifices made by soldiers, sailors, and air warriors in defending the nation.\n",
      "3. Youth movement: The speaker mentions a group of citizens in Hyderabad who are working towards transforming the youth into enlightened citizens. They are part of the Lead India 2020 Foundation, which aims to develop India into a developed nation by 2020.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, the speech emphasizes India's achievements in technology, defense, and youth development, while also showcasing the country's strong connections with Africa and its commitment to national development.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here is a summary of the speech:\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker is addressing the topic of transforming youth into enlightened citizens. They highlight the work of the Lead India 2020 Foundation, which is training thousands of students in Andhra Pradesh in partnership with the district administration. The speaker shares a personal anecdote about a student leader who changed her father's behavior after attending a training camp, and expresses confidence that this program is empowering young people through value-based education and leadership. The speaker concludes by reflecting on the richness of Indian tradition and culture, and the importance of unity and diversity in the country.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker emphasizes the importance of preserving India's rich cultural heritage and civilization, not just for current generations but for future ones as well. They express confidence in the country's progress and potential, citing its natural resources, hardworking people, and 540 million youth. The speaker urges the nation to strive to empower its citizens, particularly the youth, to aim high and achieve great things.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker outlines a vision for India in 2020, with a distinctive profile that includes:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Reduced rural-urban divide\n",
      "2. Equitable access to energy and quality water\n",
      "3. Harmony between agriculture, industry, and service sectors\n",
      "4. Education with values for all, without societal or economic discrimination\n",
      "5. India becoming the best destination for talented scholars, scientists, and investors\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker concludes by referencing a famous poem, saying that if India's youth aim high, they will reach their goals, and urges the nation to work towards this vision.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech outlines a vision for a perfect nation, where:\n",
      "\n",
      "* Healthcare is accessible to all\n",
      "* Governance is responsive, transparent, and corruption-free\n",

      "* Every individual feels included and valued\n",
      "* The nation is prosperous, healthy, secure, peaceful, and happy, with sustainable growth.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech is by Dr. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, the President of India, and it concludes by:\n",
      "\n",
      "* Expressing gratitude to the citizens for their love and support over the past five years\n",
